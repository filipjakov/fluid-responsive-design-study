		<h1>Responsive multi-column grid system (RAM)</h1>

		<p>
			Who does not know the responsive multi-column layout? A layout that changes the number of columns with the screen
			size as illustrated above. This was often solved using something like the Bootstrap grid-system, or an own
			implementation. But, this restricts you to a fixed number of columns for each screen size. If you would have five
			columns, that would not be possible in a twelve column system. Besides, you have to determine for each element the
			column span on different screen sizes.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you have many grids, your CSS or HTML does not scale well. Luckily we have CSS grids these days. With CSS grids
			we do not define the column span for each element. Instead, we let the browser determine the number of columns on
			the screen. You can achieve the illustrated scalable layout with the code snippet below:
		</p>

		<pre><code>.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(20rem, 1fr));
  width: 100%;
}</code></pre>

		<p>
			This is the so called <b>RAM</b> pattern: repeat, auto, minmax. With <code>repeat</code> we say to the browser
			that it needs to repeat its argument. For example, <code> repeat(3, 1fr)</code> would create a layout of three
			equally sized columns that fill the entire screen. But, our elements almost always have a minimum width. With the
			<code>1fr</code> we can break them. With <code>minmax(20rem, 1fr)</code>, each column has a minimum width of
			<code>20rem</code>, but scales on larger screens.
		</p>

		<p>
			The magic starts when replacing the fixed number with <code>auto-fit</code> or <code>auto-fill</code>. In short,
			<code>auto-fit</code> will expand the grid items to fill the available space. While <code>auto-fill</code> wonâ€™t
			expand the items. Instead, <code>auto-fill</code> will keep the available space reserved without altering the grid
			items width.

		<p>
			With both options, we let the browser determine the amount of available columns on the screen. When using
			<code>auto-fill</code> and <code>minmax(20rem, 1fr)</code> on a screen of <code>90rem</code> the browser creates
			four columns. The <code>auto-fit</code> option creates a maximum of four columns in this example. When there are
			only two elements to put in the grid <code>auto-fit</code> reduces the number of columns to two.
