		<h1>The Raven Technique or Poor man's Container Queries</h1>

		<section>
			<h2>Intro</h2>

			<p>
				When building components for a website, you don’t always know how that component will be used. Maybe it will be
				render as wide as the browser window is. Maybe two of them will sit side by side. Maybe it will be in some
				narrow column. The width of it doesn’t always correlate with the width of the browser window.
			</p>

			<p>Not so long ago, container queries got announced in Chromium:</p>

			<blockquote>
				This is not at all finalized, but the underlying problems we need to solve in Blink are (mostly) the same
				regardless of how the feature is accessed, so we’ll for now use this proposal as the temporary syntax.
			</blockquote>

			<p>But we are far away from getting proper browser support.</p>

			<p>
				It’s common to reach a point where having container based queries for the CSS of the component would be super
				handy. If you search around the web for solution to this, you’ll probably find several JavaScript-based
				solutions. But those come at a price: extra dependencies, styling that requires JavaScript, and polluted
				application logic and design logic.
			</p>

			<p>I am a strong believer in separation of concerns, and layout is a CSS concern.</p>

			<p>
				We already familiarized ourselves with <a href="./un-holy-albatros.html">The (Un)Holy Albatros</a>, but all that
				is happening is a rows-to-columns switch. So, what does CSS have offer that we could tap into?
