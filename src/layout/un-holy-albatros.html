		<h1>The (Un)Holy Albatross</h1>

		<blockquote>
			The Holy Albatross is a technique which breaks a row of elements into a column of elements at a specific
			<b>parent</b> width.

			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<p>
				With Flexbox you can combine wrapping (<code>flex-wrap: wrap</code>) and growing (<code>flex-grow: 1</code>) to
				ensure all flex items fall into their rightful place across different viewport widths.
			</p>
			<p>The trouble is, sometimes you want your items to wrap in a very particular way. For instance:</p>
			<img src="https://every-layout.dev/images/illustrations/switcher_bypass.svg" alt="" />

			<p>
				Well, how about <code>@media</code> queries? No can do: the component, defined outside of context, could be
				instantiated within a container/parent element of any width. Context is variable, but all
				<code>@media</code> queries can do is adjust things according to the constant that is the viewport.

				JavaScript all the things? A combination of
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver">ResizeObserver</a> and
				<a href="../basics/custom-properties/index.html">CSS custom properties</a> could do the trick... But there is
				another way.
			</p>

			<h2>The Holy Albatross üôèüôèüôè</h2>
			<p>
				The idea is to switch a Flexbox context between a horizontal and a vertical layout at a given, container-based
				breakpoint. Consider the following:
			</p>

			<pre><code>.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.container > * {
  flex-grow: 1;
}</code></pre>

			<p>
				The <code>flex-basis</code> value enters the (current) width of the container, expressed as <code>100%</code>,
				into a calculation with the designated (<code>30rem</code>) breakpoint:
			</p>
			<pre><code>30rem - 100%</code></pre>
			<p>
				Depending on the parsed value of <code>100%</code>, this will return either a positive or negative value:
				positive if the container is narrower than <code>30rem</code>, or negative if it is wider. This number is then
				multiplied by <code>999</code> to produce either a very large positive number or a very large negative number:
			</p>
			<pre><code>(30rem - 100%) * 999</code></pre>
			<p>Here is the code with the <code>flex-basis</code> declaration:</p>
			<pre><code>.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.container > * {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-basis: calc((30rem - 100%) * 999);
}</code></pre>

			<p>
				A negative <code>flex-basis</code> value is invalid, and dropped; <code>flex-basis</code> line is ignored, and
				the rest of the CSS is still applied. The erroneous negative <code>flex-basis</code> value is corrected to
				<code>0</code> and, because <code>flex-grow</code> is present, each element grows to take up an equal proportion
				of horizontal space.
			</p>

			<img src="https://every-layout.dev/images/illustrations/switcher_flex-basis_calc.svg" alt="" />

			<p>
				If, on the other hand, the calculated <code>flex-basis</code> value is a large positive number, each element
				'maxes out' to take up a whole row. This results in the vertical configuration.
			</p>

			<h3>Gutters</h3>
			<p>
				To support margins ('<i>gutters</i>'; '<i>gaps</i>') between the subject elements, the
				<code>flex-basis</code> calculation needs to be adapted to compensate for the increased width produced by
				stretching the parent element. That is, by applying negative margins on all sides, the parent becomes wider than
				its container and their 100% values no longer match.
			</p>
			<pre><code>.container {
  --space: 1rem;
  --threshold: 30rem;

  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  /* Multiply by -1 to make negative */
  margin: calc(var(--space) / 2 * -1);
}

.container > * {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-basis: calc((var(--threshold) - (100% - var(--space))) * 999);
  /* Half the value to each element, combining to make the whole */
  margin: calc(var(--space) / 2);
}
			</code></pre>

			<p>
				(This will become redundant when the <code>gap</code> property is more widely supported. Think grid-gap but for
				Grid AND Flexbox)
			</p>

			<h3>Managing proportions</h3>
			<p>
				There is no reason why one or more of the elements, when in a horizontal configuration, cannot be alloted more
				or less of the available space. By giving the second element (<code>:nth-child(2)</code>)
				<code>flex-grow: 2</code> is will become twice as wide as its siblings (and the siblings will shrink to
				compensate).
			</p>

			<pre><code>.container > *:nth-child(2) {
  flex-grow: 2;
}</code></pre>

			<img src="https://every-layout.dev/images/illustrations/switcher_flex_2.svg" alt="" />

			<p>Check the following example which summarizes the previous solutions:</p>
			<iframe height="350px" src="https://codepen.io/heydon/embed/pqGgbR" frameborder="0"></iframe>

			<h3>Quantity threshold</h3>
			<p>In the horizontal configuration, the amount of space alloted each element is determined by two things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The total space available (the width of the container)</li>
				<li>The number of sibling elements</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				So far, the switch happend according to the available space. But we can add as many elements as we like, and
				they will lay out together horizontally above the breakpoint (or threshold).
				<b>The more elements we add, the less space each gets alloted, and things can easily start to get squashed up</b
				>. Consider the following code:
			</p>

			<pre><code>.container > *:nth-last-child(n+5),
.container > *:nth-last-child(n+5) ~ * {
  flex-basis: 100%;
}</code></pre>

			<blockquote>
				Note: This pseudo-class is essentially the same as :nth-child, except it counts items backwards from the end,
				not forwards from the beginning.
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				Here, we are applying a <code>flex-basis</code> of <code>100%</code> to each element, only where there are five
				or more elements in total. The <code>nth-last-child(n+5)</code> selector targets any elements that are more than
				4 from the end of the set. Then, the general sibling combinator (<code>~</code>) applies the same rule to the
				rest of the elements (it matches anything after <code>:nth-last-child(n+5)</code>). If there are fewer that 5
				items, no <code>:nth-last-child(n+5)</code> elements and the style is not applied.

			<h2>The UnHoly Albatros üö´üôè</h2>

			<p>
				<b>The Holy Albatros</b> It is a very clever way to responsively stack 3+ columns into rows based on container
				size in a single step, using
				<code>flex-basis:calc((breakpoint - 100%) * 999); flex-grow:1</code>
			</p>

			<p>
				However, because it takes over
				<code>flex-basis</code> and <code>flex-grow</code>, this technique makes it hard to set the
				<code>width</code> of columns. (NOTE: content ‚Äî> width ‚Äî> flex-basis (limted by max|min-width))
			</p>

			<h3>Harnessing the black magic of <code>clamp</code></h3>

			<p>
				To solve the previous problems, the UnHoly Albatross uses <code>min-width</code>, combined with
				<code>clamp</code>:
			</p>

			<pre><code>.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.container > * {
  min-width: clamp(0px, (30rem - 100%) * 999, 100%);
}</code></pre>

			<p>
				By moving container query to <code>min-width</code>, it frees up <code>flex-basis</code> and
				<code>flex-grow</code> so the width can be set freely.
			</p>

			<p>Check the demo:</p>
			<iframe height="350px" src="https://codepen.io/Miragecraft/embed/VweEoOG" frameborder="0"></iframe>

			<h3>Bonus: Reversing order of stacked columns</h3>

			<p>
				A common use case is to raise the right hand column to the top when stacking columns vertically, but changing
				the order doesn't seem to be possible here.
			</p>

			<p>
				The only value that acts as the trigger is the width value such as <code>(40rem - 100%) * 999</code>, we can't
				alter the <code>order</code> property with it because order only wants integer, and our trigger value must
				contain a width.
			</p>

			<p>
				However, <code>flex-direction: row-reverse</code> has a curious property - the <code>x</code> direction is
				reversed, but the row still wraps downwards, this means when columns are 100% wide it behaves like
				<code>flex-direction: column</code>.
			</p>

			<pre><code>.v-reverse { flex-direction:row-reverse }
.v-reverse > *:nth-child(1) { order:-1 }
.v-reverse > *:nth-child(2) { order:-2 }
.v-reverse > *:nth-child(3) { order:-3 }
.v-reverse > *:nth-child(4) { order:-4 }</code></pre>

			<h2>Use cases:</h2>

			<p>Especially useful where each element should be considered equal, or part of a continuum.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Card components advertising products should share the same width no matter the orientation, otherwise one or
					more cards could be perceived as highlighted or featured in some way.
				</li>
				<li>
					A set of numbered steps is also easier on cognition if those steps are laid out along one horizontal or
					vertical line.
				</li>
				<li>Header navigation component - horizontal on large screen/vertical (behing hamburger) on smaller screens</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				*<b>NOTE</b>: the Albatross is sutable for 2+ components (in a container). Otherwise, (if there were 2), using
				your usual <code>flex</code> (<code>flex-basis</code> with <code>flex-wrap</code>) could suffice
